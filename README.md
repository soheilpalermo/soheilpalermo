# Soheil Dabooyeh

ðŸ‘‹ Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is Soheil, and Iâ€™m excited to share my journey with you. After years of working in healthcare operations and administration, I discovered my true passion in the field of data analytics and data science. Over the past year, I have been fully immersed in this dynamic field, developing expertise in tools and techniques such as Python, SQL, and Machine Learning.
I am currently completing the Data Analytics Bootcamp at Monash University, where Iâ€™ve gained invaluable hands-on experience working on projects that demonstrate my ability to analyse complex datasets, build machine learning models, and create impactful data visualisations. My previous role as a healthcare supervisor gave me firsthand insights into the challenges of healthcare systems, and it fuels my ambition to use data science to drive innovation and improve healthcare delivery.
Iâ€™m excited to continue growing in this field and applying my skills to solve real-world problems. Thank you for stopping by my GitHub page, and I look forward to sharing my journey with you!
